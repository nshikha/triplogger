For Testing, not sure if there's a better way to do it but here's what I did that worked for me:

I used Debug->location->Freeway Drive
Then once the speed was greater than 10.0 mph,
I set a nearby Location in Debug->location->Custom Location

For eg:
Apple HQ                        37.331789, -122.029620
Washington Square Park          37.8009, -122.4100


Ocean                           37, 122
